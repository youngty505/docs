= Manage Resources Using the Cloud API
:description: Use the cloud API to manage resources in your Redpanda Cloud clusters.
:page-cloud: true

The Redpanda Cloud API is a collection of REST APIs that allow you to interact with different parts of Redpanda Cloud. The Data Plane APIs enable you to programmatically manage the resources within your clusters, including topics, users, access control lists (ACLs), and connectors. You can call the API endpoints directly, or use tools like Terraform or Python scripts to automate cluster management.

== Requirements

. You must be a customer with an existing organization in Redpanda Cloud.
. You can only use one organization for authentication.
. You must have the admin role in Redpanda Console.
. The data plane contains the actual Redpanda clusters. Every cluster is its own data plane, and so it has its own distinct Data Plane API URL. See the below section on <<get-data-plane-api-url,getting a cluster's data plane API URL>>.

== Use the API reference to interact with the Data Plane APIs

All other services consist of Data Plane API endpoints. To make requests to these endpoints: 

. Make a Get Cluster request for your target cluster.
. The Get Cluster response contains the Data Plane API URL. Copy the value of `dataplane_api.url`. 
. Click API Servers in the sidebar and select “{dataplane_api_url} - Dataplane API”.
. Paste the URL into the dataplane_api_url input field.

== Get Data Plane API URL

To retrieve the Data Plane API URL of a cluster, call GET /v1beta1/clusters/{id}.

The response includes a `dataplane_api.url` value:

[,json,role=no-copy,lines=6]
----
{
  "id": "....",
  "name": "my-cluster",
....
  "dataplane_api": {
	"url": "https://api-xyz.abc.fmc.ppd.cloud.redpanda.com"
  },
...
}
----

== Data Plane APIs

=== Create a user

https://docs.api.redpanda.com/#post-/v1alpha1/users

To create a new user in your Redpanda cluster, make a POST request to the `/v1alpha1/users` endpoint, including the SASL mechanism, username, and password in the request body:

[,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://api-aeb32d9b.cn20bu40d061nvem7sv0.fmc.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/v1alpha1/users" \
 -H "accept: application/json"\

 -H "content-type: application/json" \
 -d '{"mechanism":"SASL_MECHANISM_SCRAM_SHA_256","name":"payment-service","password":"secure-password"}'
----

The success response returns the newly-created username and SASL mechanism:

[.no-copy]
----
{
  "user": {
    "name": "payment-service",
    "mechanism": "SASL_MECHANISM_SCRAM_SHA_256"
  }
}
----

=== Create an ACL

https://docs.api.redpanda.com/#post-/v1alpha1/acls 

To create a new ACL in your Redpanda cluster, make a `POST /v1alpha1/acls` request like the example below. This example ACL allows all operations on any Kafka topic for a user with the name `payment-service`.

[,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://api-aeb32d9b.cn20bu40d061nvem7sv0.fmc.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/v1alpha1/acls" \
 -H "accept: application/json"\
 -H "content-type: application/json" \
 -d '{"host":"*","operation":"OPERATION_ALL","permission_type":"PERMISSION_TYPE_ALLOW","principal":"User:payment-service","resource_name":"*","resource_pattern_type":"RESOURCE_PATTERN_TYPE_LITERAL","resource_type":"RESOURCE_TYPE_TOPIC"}'
----

The success response is empty, with a 201 status code.

[.no-copy]
----
{}
----

=== Create a topic

https://docs.api.redpanda.com/#post-/v1alpha1/topics 

To create a new Kafka topic without specifying any further parameters such as the desired topic-level configuration or partition count, make a POST request to `/v1alpha1/topics` like the following:

[,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://api-aeb32d9b.cn20bu40d061nvem7sv0.fmc.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/v1alpha1/topics" \
 -H "accept: application/json"\
 -H "content-type: application/json" \
 -d '{"name":"my-simple-test-topic"}'
----

=== Create a connector

https://docs.api.redpanda.com/#post-/v1alpha1/connect/clusters/-cluster_name-/connectors 

To create a managed connector, make a POST request to `/v1alpha1/connect/clusters/{cluster_name}/connectors`. The following example shows how to create a S3 sink connector with name `my-connector`:

[,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://api-aeb32d9b.cn20bu40d061nvem7sv0.fmc.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/v1alpha1/connect/clusters/redpanda/connectors" \
 -H "accept: application/json"\
-H "content-type: application/json" \
 -d '{"config":{"connector.class":"com.redpanda.kafka.connect.s3.S3SinkConnector","topics":"test-topic","aws.secret.access.key":"secret-key","aws.s3.bucket.name":"bucket-name","aws.access.key.id":"access-key","aws.s3.bucket.check":"false","region":"us-east-1"},"name":"my-sample-connector"}'
----

You can expect a success response such as:

[.no-copy]
----
{
  "name": "my-sample-connector",
  "config": {
    "aws.access.key.id": "access-key",
    "aws.s3.bucket.check": "false",
    "aws.s3.bucket.name": "bucket-name",
    "aws.secret.access.key": "secret-key",
    "connector.class": "com.redpanda.kafka.connect.s3.S3SinkConnector",
    "name": "my-sample-connector",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "topics": "test-topic"
  },
  "tasks": [],
  "type": "sink"
}
----

=== Restart a connector

https://docs.api.redpanda.com/#post-/v1alpha1/connect/clusters/-cluster_name-/connectors/-name-/restart 

To restart a connector, make a POST request to the `/v1alpha1/connect/clusters/{cluster_name}/connectors/{name}/restart` endpoint:

[,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://api-aeb32d9b.cn20bu40d061nvem7sv0.fmc.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/v1alpha1/connect/clusters/redpanda/connectors/my-connector/restart" \
 -H "accept: application/json"\
 -H "content-type: application/json" \
 -d '{"include_tasks":false,"only_failed":false}'
----
