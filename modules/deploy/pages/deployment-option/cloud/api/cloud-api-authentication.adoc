== Request an access token

. Go to the https://cloud.redpanda.com/clients[Clients] page in the Redpanda Cloud UI to create an OAuth Client. 
+
NOTE: Clients have admin privileges by default, and user roles do not apply for the API.

. Click *Add client*. Enter a name and description.

. Retrieve the client ID and secret by clicking *Copy ID* and *Copy Secret*. Make a POST request to `\https://auth.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/oauth/token` with the ID and secret in the request body. To see code examples for getting a token, click the *Request an API token*.
+
The request response provides the access token that remains valid for one hour.

== Authenticate API requests

You must pass the access token in the authorization header of your API requests: 

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_TOKEN"
```
