= Redpanda Cloud API Overview
:description: Learn about using the Cloud API to manage clusters and cloud resources.
:page-cloud: true

The Redpanda Cloud API is a collection of REST APIs that allow you to interact with different parts of Redpanda Cloud. You can call the API endpoints directly, or use tools like Terraform or Python scripts to automate cluster management.

// Control Plane API - what does control plane mean
// Data Plane APIs - what does data plane mean

// How is the cloud API different from Kafka API, and the other Redpanda APIs - HTTP Proxy, Schema Registry, and Admin APIs? When to use Cloud API vs the other APIs?

== Requirements

. You must be a customer with an existing organization in Redpanda Cloud.
. You can only use one organization for authentication.

== Authentication

. Go to the https://cloud.redpanda.com/clients[Redpanda Cloud UI] to create an OAuth Client. 
+
NOTE: Clients have admin privileges by default, and user roles do not apply for the API.

. Click *Add client*. Enter a name and description.

. Retrieve the client ID and secret by clicking *Copy ID* and *Copy Secret*. Make a POST request to `\https://auth.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/oauth/token` with the ID and secret in the request body. To see code examples for getting a token, click the *Request an API token*.
+
The request response provides the access token that remains valid for one hour.

You must pass the access token in the authorization header of your API requests: 

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_TOKEN"
```

== Pagination

When an endpoint returns a list containing more items than can be returned in a single response, the response object includes a `next_page_token`. You can pass the token value as a parameter in the next request. When the full list has been returned, `next_page_token` is an empty string.

== Use the API reference to interact with the Cloud API

All Cloud API endpoints are documented in our API reference. In the API docs, you can:

- Invoke all endpoints directly from your browser
- Inspect the autogenerated cURL request based on the input parameters you provide
- See the request and response schema for different HTTP status codes, and request and response examples 

Before you can issue actual requests from the browser against the API, you must:

. <<authentication,Authenticate>> with your Redpanda Cloud account.
. In the API reference, click *Authentication* in the sidebar.
. Click the *Get Token* button. Do not edit the input field next to the button.
. If successful, the text “1 API key applied” displays near the top of the page.
. Choose the correct API server for your request.
